# cbr-cli
Submit your solutions to codebreaker.xyz without leaving the terminal.
This is a cli utility written in Go that allows you to directly submit your solutions to a problem to codebreaker.xyz,
all in the comfort of your commandline.

## Usage
`cbr <problem id> <path-to-solution>` </br>
Example: </br>
`cbr helloworld main.cpp`

### macOS

### Windows
If you are a windows user I don't get why you would ever prefer the cmd prompt or PowerShell over the actual codebreaker webpage.
Like seriously. Imagine having such a god awful "terminal". </br>,
But if you really want to use it? **Clone the repository and build it from source.** </br>
**I will not provide Windows builds because I don't have access to a Windows machine.**
